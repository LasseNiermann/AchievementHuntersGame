# AchievementHuntersGame
Fake games for an upcoming game.

## What is this?
I am working on a game called "Achievement Hunters", more information later.
The game requires a few dummy games. You can see examples here in the repo.

## How can I help?
It would be great if you could contribute.
The images need to represent a game (must not be a real game) but without any copyright stuff on it.

- PNG
- 315px x 118px
- name: "gameX.png" The X must represent a number which hasn't been used yet. If you are unsure, just call your stuff "gameX1.png", "gameX2.png", etc.

An image is not a game. We need a short info file: 
"datagameX.json"
```
{
    "name": "Some Game",
    "genre": "Open World",
    "developer": "Some Developer/Publisher",
    "hours": 1, // To complete the game and get all achievements; up to you :p
    "achievements": 8 // Total amount of achievements; up to you :p
}
```

Just open a pull request <3

Have a nice day,
